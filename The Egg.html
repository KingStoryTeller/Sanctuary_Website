<h1>The Egg</h1>    

<p>Today, I woke up wanting an egg for breakfast. What an adventure that was. I turn on the stove, high, and drop some oil. The sizzling sound of heating oil is music to my ears. I pull out the sausages, throw them on the pan.  Pull out the some greens, put them on the pan. They start to cook. My God does it smell good. You know what would go well with this, an Egg. Oh Shoot! I forgot the Egg. I run to the  fridge, grab an egg and throw it on the pan. It starts to crisp up with a brown color, cooking instantly. I say fuck it, throw it on the plate and eat it. My God is this a good Egg.</p>
